Run an adversarial OpenCode review through the shared plugin runtime.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return OpenCode's output verbatim to the user.

Foreground flow:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/opencode-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Background flow:

```typescript
Bash({
  command: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/opencode-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "$ARGUMENTS"`,
  description: "OpenCode adversarial review",
  run_in_background: true
})
```

- After launching, tell the user: "OpenCode adversarial review started in the background. Check `/opencode:status` for progress."
